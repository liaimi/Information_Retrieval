Information_Retrieval
=====================
This repository shows four programming assignments done for information retrieval.

The first one builds a simple indexing and retrieval system for a search engine, which includes an uncompressed index and retrieval
for Boolean conjunctive queries using blocked sort-based indexing algorithm, a compressed index using VB encoding and gamma encoding.

The second one builds a spell corrector.

The third one it to rank the results given some queries and corresponding search results, implementing the cosine similarity, BM25F 
ranking algorithm.

The fourth one is also on ranking, but using machine learning approach, including the pointwise approach using linear regression and 
the pairwise approach employing support vector machines.
